# Experience ‚úÖ

### iOS Development
- Refactored a UIKit banking application to SwiftUI as part of a four-engineer team, modernizing the user interface resulting in a 15% improvement in initial load times.
- Utilized Instruments to analyze and optimize encrypted data handling, resolving a memory leak and reducing memory consumption by 35% during large data operations.
- Engineered core functionalities using SwiftOTP for a password manager application, including token storage and generation of time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), improving user security and account protection.
- Leveraged CryptoSwift to implement on-device AES-256 encryption for secure storage and management of sensitive user credentials, including usernames, passwords, and TOTP secrets.
- Developed fluid and engaging user interfaces by leveraging Core Animation to create custom animations and transitions within a messaging application, enhancing user experience and application interactivity.
- Architected and maintained comprehensive unit and UI tests using XCTest and XCUITest, ensuring code reliability, functionality, and a 30% reduction in crash reports measured by Sentry.

### Physics Programming
- Physics Simulations in iOS using Swift and SceneKit
  - Built sphere simulation demonstrating mass-dependent behavior and wind force effects.
  - Designed particle system for fluid behavior simulation using SceneKit's physics engine.
  - Implemented physics-based interactions between 200+ particles and solid container.
  - Tuned physical properties (restitution, friction, damping) to achieve realistic fluid dynamics.
  
- Box3D, a 3D extension of Box2D in C++ (In Progress)
  - Implementing rigid body dynamics.
  - Implementing an iterative constraint solver.
  - Implementing collision detection: dynamic AABB tree (broad-phase) and SAT/GJK (narrow-phase).
