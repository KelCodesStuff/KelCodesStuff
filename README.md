<h1 align="left"> iOS Engineer üì± |  Physics Programmer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª </h1>

iOS Engineer with expertise in SwiftUI, Metal, Core Animation, and Core Data (including experience optimizing performance-critical applications using Instruments and efficient memory management). 

I'm developing Box3D, a 3D physics engine built upon Box2D, prioritizing a modular architecture, comprehensive documentation, and a performance-oriented codebase for simulating rigid body dynamics.

iOS Development
- Redesigned a legacy UIKit financial application using SwiftUI, resulting in a 25% reduction in size and a 15% improvement in load times.
- Collaborated with designers to implement a new user interface for a financial tracking application using SwiftUI, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement.
- Built core functionalities using SwiftOTP for an authenticator application, including token storage and generation of time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), improving user security and account protection.
- Leveraged CryptoSwift to implement on-device AES-256 encryption for secure storage and management of sensitive user credentials, including usernames, passwords, and TOTP secrets.
- Applied Instruments to profile iOS/macOS applications, identifying and optimizing performance bottlenecks, and reduced memory consumption by 15%.
- Developed and maintained comprehensive unit and UI tests using XCTest and XCUITest frameworks, ensuring code quality, functionality, and a 10% increase in app stability.

Physics Programming
- Developing Box3D, a 3D extension of Box2D in C++ (In Progress) [Box3D](https://github.com/KelCodesStuff/Box3D/)
  - Implementing rigid body dynamics.
  - Implementing an iterative constraint solver.
  - Implementing collision detection: dynamic AABB tree (broad-phase) and SAT/GJK (narrow-phase).
