<h1 align="left"> iOS Engineer üì± |  Physics Programmer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª </h1>

### Hello, üëãüèº I'm Kel 

A results-driven iOS Engineer with 7 years of experience developing and launching highly successful applications, achieving over 350K downloads. Expert in SwiftUI, UIKit, Core Data, and Concurrency, with a proven ability to optimize for performance and memory management. Proficient in architecting applications using MVC and MVVM patterns, and adept at implementing UI/UX principles to create intuitive and engaging mobile experiences.

In my spare time, I'm developing Box3D, a 3D physics engine built upon Box2D. Motivated by my passion for game development and a desire to explore advanced physics simulations, Box3D prioritizes a modern architecture and a performance-oriented codebase.

iOS Development
- Refactored a UIKit banking application to SwiftUI as part of a four-engineer team, modernizing the user interface resulting in a 15% improvement in initial load times.
- Utilized Instruments to analyze and optimize encrypted data handling in the password vault, resolving a memory leak and reducing memory consumption by 35% during large data operations.
- Built core functionalities using SwiftOTP for a password manager application, including token storage and generation of time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), improving user security and account protection.
- Leveraged CryptoSwift to implement on-device AES-256 encryption for secure storage and management of sensitive user credentials, including usernames, passwords, and TOTP secrets.
- Developed and maintained comprehensive unit and UI tests using XCTest and XCUITest, ensuring code quality, functionality, and a 30% reduction in crash reports measured by Sentry.



Physics Programming
- Developing Box3D, a 3D extension of Box2D in C++ (In Progress) [Box3D](https://github.com/KelCodesStuff/Box3D/)
  - Implementing rigid body dynamics.
  - Implementing an iterative constraint solver.
  - Implementing collision detection: dynamic AABB tree (broad-phase) and SAT/GJK (narrow-phase).
