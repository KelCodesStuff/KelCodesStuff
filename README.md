# Experience ‚úÖ

### Mobile
- Empowered mobile feature teams to increase code coverage to 70% through leading the design and implementation of scalable automated test frameworks using XCUITest, and Compose Test.
- Pioneered end-to-end and integration test automation for mobile applications using XCUITest and Espresso, elevating overall functional code coverage from 0% to a robust 40%.
- Significantly reduced unit test execution time by 30% and achieved 90% test coverage for user account features by developing and executing automated suites using XCTest and JUnit.
- Reduced regression issues by 20% by building and maintaining robust mobile testing infrastructure (Appium, TestNG, Firebase Test Lab) that enabled comprehensive automated end-to-end, functional, and regression testing.
- Identified performance regressions in mobile applications by leveraging Xcode Instruments and Android Studio Profiler to analyze CPU, and memory, resulting in a 15% reduction in ANRs/crashes and ensuring a smoother user experience.

### Web
- Enabled web feature teams to boost code coverage to 80% through developing and implementing a scalable automation test framework using Cypress.
- Improved AI threat detection accuracy by 30% by driving the development of a specialized automation testing framework using Pytest.
- Verified the integrity and reliability of alert data pipelines by implementing automated validation frameworks using Pytest, leading to a 15% reduction in data-related production incidents.
- Ensured 99% uptime and increased deployment frequency by 25% through proactive maintenance of testing infrastructure and seamless integration of automation frameworks into AWS CodePipeline and AWS Device Farm.
- Streamlined root cause identification and resolution for errors and logs across staging and production environments using Sentry, proactively identifying and addressing critical test gaps.

### API
- Achieved a 25% improvement in API response times by conducting targeted performance and load testing with Locust for critical REST and GraphQL endpoints, effectively identifying and resolving bottlenecks.
- Developed and executed data-driven API tests using Postman collections, verifying backend service reliability and performance, which reduced defects by 40%.
