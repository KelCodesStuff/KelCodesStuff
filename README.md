### Hello, I'm Kel 👋🏼

I'm a Software Quality Architect with a specialization in designing and scaling test automation frameworks. Over my 11-year career, I have architected comprehensive testing infrastructure for mobile, web, and API platforms within SaaS and Cloud environments. I lead the implementation of TDD/BDD methodologies, which enable engineering teams to deliver high-quality products and decrease critical production issues by over 40% across the software development lifecycle.
