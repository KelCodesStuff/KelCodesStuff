Game Development
- Developed a custom real-time rendering engine using Metal, supporting dynamic lighting, shadows, and post-processing effects. Achieved a 30% performance increase in frame rates across a wide range of mobile devices.
- Improved rendering performance by 25% by optimizing the graphics pipeline and implementing advanced culling techniques, reducing GPU overdraw and increasing frame rate stability.
- Created shaders using GLSL and MSL to support real-time global illumination, physically based rendering (PBR), and advanced post-processing effects, enhancing the visual quality of 3D scenes.
- Prototyped and iterated on various gameplay mechanics and features, leveraging internal testing to fine-tune gameplay balance and enhance player engagement.
- Implemented an automation testing framework for game assets and shaders, using the Unity Test Framework and PyTest, reducing manual testing time by 50% and identifying rendering issues early in the development pipeline.


iOS Development
- Developed views using SwiftUI within the MVVM architecture, creating user-friendly interfaces and fluid interactions.
- Utilized Swift to implement on-device AES encryption for secure credential storage and management, adhering to industry-standard security practices.
- Architected core functionalities, including secure token storage and generation of time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), ensuring robust authentication processes.
- Designed and executed end-to-end test strategies for mobile apps using XCTest and XCUITest, verifying functionality across UI and integration layers, achieving 70% code coverage.
