# Experience

### üì± Mobile 
- Led mobile feature teams to increase code coverage from 10% to 70% by designing and implementing automated test frameworks using XCUITest and Compose Test.
- Pioneered end-to-end and integration test automation for mobile applications using XCUITest and Espresso, which reduced build and test execution time by 50%.
- Optimized manual testing efforts by 30% and achieved 90% test coverage for user account features by developing unit test suites using XCTest and JUnit.
- Architected the mobile testing infrastructure using Appium, TestNG, and Firebase Test Lab, enabling automated end-to-end, functional, and regression testing and reducing prerelease issues by 20%.
- Leveraged Xcode Instruments and Android Profiler to analyze CPU and memory usage and identify performance issues in mobile applications, resulting in a 15% reduction in ANRs/crashes and a smoother user experience.

### üï∏Ô∏è Web
- Led agile teams in boosting the number of regressions detected by 50% through developing and implementing an test automation framework using Cypress.
- Drove the architecture and implementation of a component level testing framework using React Testing Library and Jest, accelerating UI testing cycles by 40% within a CI/CD pipeline.
- Architected a test automation infrastructure and framework using Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, and CircleCI which accelerated regression testing cycles by 25%.
- Engineered the enhancement of a Pytest framework for AI model testing, implementing new methodologies that increased detection accuracy by 30% for a core product feature.
- Decreased time-to-resolution for production errors by 30%¬†by leveraging Sentry for real-time error tracking, which proactively identified critical test gaps and streamlined root cause analysis.
