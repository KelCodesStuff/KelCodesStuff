# Experience ‚úÖ

### iOS Development
- Refactored a UIKit banking application to SwiftUI as part of a four engineer team, modernizing the user interface resulting in a 15% improvement in initial load times.
- Optimized large data operations by leveraging async/await to offload processing to background queues, resulting in a 35% reduction in memory usage during peak usage and preventing UI freezes.
- Utilized Instruments to analyze and optimize encrypted data handling, resolving memory leaks and reducing memory consumption by 35% during large data operations.
- Developed fluid and engaging user interfaces by leveraging Core Animation to create custom animations and transitions, enhancing user experience and application interactivity.
- Built core functionalities using SwiftOTP for a password manager application, including token storage and generation of time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), improving user security and account protection.
- Leveraged CryptoSwift to implement on-device AES-256 encryption for secure storage and management of sensitive user credentials, including usernames, passwords, and TOTP secrets.


### Quality Engineering
- Led the design and implementation of scalable automated test frameworks for mobile applications using XCUITest and Compose Test, empowering feature teams to increase code coverage by up to 70%.
- Developed and executed automated unit test suites using XCTest and Swift, achieving 90% test coverage for user flows and reducing test execution time by 30%.
- Maintained testing infrastructure, developing and integrating automation frameworks into AWS CodePipeline and AWS Device Farm, ensuring 99% uptime and increasing deployment frequency by 25%.
- Drove the development of an automated testing framework using Pytest and NumPy for AI threat detection systems, improving detection accuracy by 30%.
- Developed and implemented end-to-end tests for distributed data ingestion pipelines, validating data integrity and performance across various microservices and decreasing data ingestion latency by 15%.
- Conducted performance/load testing with Locust for REST and GraphQL endpoints, identifying bottlenecks and achieving a 25% improvement in API response times.
- Utilized Sentry to analyze errors and logs in staging and production environments, with the goal of root cause identification and resolution and identifying test gaps.
